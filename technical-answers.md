### How long did you spend on the coding test?

- I worked on the challenge over a couple of hours, but I spent additional time (approximately 2.5 hours) to write all the tests carefully to make sure they routes worked exactly as intended.

### What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

- I would add a frontend interface using React that allowed the blog to be visualized.

### Why did you choose the language you used for the coding test?

- Node.js is one of the best languages for coding in the backend. Since my principal training and experience is in JavaScript and Node.js, it was much more efficient for me to choose to write in Node.js.

### Did you learn anything new while solving this challenge?

- Absolutely! The best thing I learned was how to impletement unit testing for HTTP requests. I became comfortable establishing tests for all my routes and to check whether users with different roles would be able to access the endpoints or not. It was also very fun to build!
